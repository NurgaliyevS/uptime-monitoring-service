## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How frequently should monitoring checks occur?**
A: Critical systems require 30-60 second intervals; non-critical systems can use 5-15 minute checks.

**Q: What's the ideal monitoring data retention period?**
A: Maintain detailed data for 30 days and aggregated data for 13 months to identify comprehensive trends.

**Q: Can monitoring tools monitor themselves?**
A: Yes, implement meta-monitoring to ensure monitoring system reliability.

**Q: How many monitoring locations are recommended?**
A: Use 3-5 geographically distributed monitoring points for robust coverage.

**Q: What role does synthetic monitoring play?**
A: Synthetic monitoring simulates user interactions to detect potential issues proactively.

**Q: How should alert thresholds be configured?**
A: Base thresholds on historical performance data with a 20% buffer to reduce false positives.
