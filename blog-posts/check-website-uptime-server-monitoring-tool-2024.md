## What is Website Uptime?
**Website uptime** refers to the total time a website remains accessible to users. Websites are expected to have uptime percentages as high as 99.9%, often called "three nines" uptime, to indicate reliability.

### Why is Website Uptime Important?
Website uptime is crucial because it directly impacts user experience, SEO rankings, and revenue. For businesses, even minor downtime can lead to lost sales, especially if users can't access services or products when needed. A high uptime percentage signifies reliability, which is essential for both user trust and operational success.

## Exploring Server Uptime Monitoring

### What is Server Uptime Monitoring?
**Server uptime monitoring** involves keeping track of a server’s online status, identifying downtimes, and alerting the site admin immediately when an issue occurs.
