Website uptime is essential in today’s digital world. When a site goes down, even briefly, it can lead to lost revenue, decreased user trust, and negative SEO impact. This is where **server uptime monitoring** and **uptime monitoring tools** step in to help you keep your website running smoothly.

## What is Website Uptime?

Website uptime refers to the time your site is fully operational and accessible to users. It’s typically expressed as a percentage over a specific period, such as 99.9% uptime, which means your site is down for a minimal amount of time during that period.

### Why is Uptime Important?

1. **User Experience**: A site that’s consistently available provides a better user experience, leading to higher satisfaction rates.
2. **Business Revenue**: For e-commerce sites, downtime translates directly to lost sales. Every minute your site is down can cost you money.
3. **Search Engine Ranking**: Search engines like Google consider uptime as a ranking factor. Frequent downtimes can hurt your site's visibility.
