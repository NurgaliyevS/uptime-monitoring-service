## Understanding Website Uptime

**Website uptime** essentially tracks how often your site is available to users. Downtime, on the other hand, is any period during which users can’t reach the site. High uptime rates – ideally 99.9% or better – indicate a stable, reliable website.

### The Role of Uptime in SEO

Search engines favor sites that stay online consistently, so uptime can influence your SEO. Downtime can mean search bots can't index your site, which impacts rankings. The goal? Stay online as much as possible!

## Benefits of Monitoring Uptime

Regularly monitoring uptime offers clear advantages. It ensures your website remains accessible, helps you catch technical issues before they become problems, and maintains customer trust.
