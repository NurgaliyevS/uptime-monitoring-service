## How do I do it manually?

You need to visit your **website** consistently and check it. If there are some **errors**, you will need to fix it. There are some **cons** and **pros**.

Cons:

- Simple check
- No setup is required.

Pros:

- You can't check it 24/7
- You won't get any notifications if any downtime happens.

## How do I do it automatically ?

You need a monitoring system that will check your website 24/7. If any downtime happens, it should notify you. But how do I do it? You have different options:

- [UptimeFriend.com](https://uptimefriend.com/)
- [UptimeRobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com/)
- [Instatus](https://instatus.com/)

## What are the differences between them ?

**UptimeFriend.com** has everything you need to work with. UptimeRobot.com is good to work with if you have complex and heavy systems. Instatus is good when you have 1000 monitors.

## Conclusion

We checked our websites manually and automatically. Manually is good when you have one website and a limited budget. Otherwise, the automatic system helps you monitor 24/7, and in any case of downtime, we will get notifications.Â 

[UptimeFriend.com](https://uptimefriend.com/) is perfect if you want a simple notification system.
UptimeRobot.com is good when you work with a heavy and complex system.
Instatus is good when you work with thousands of monitors.
