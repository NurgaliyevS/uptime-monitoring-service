## Introduction

Running a website? Then you probably know how important uptime is for your business. But what exactly *is* uptime, and how do you **check website uptime** consistently? Well, uptime refers to the amount of time your website is up and running without any disruptions. In an increasingly digital world, any downtime can result in loss of traffic, revenue, and trust.

When it comes to **server uptime monitoring**, there are plenty of tools out there. Each tool promises to give you real-time insights, but not all are created equal. In this article, we’ll break down how to keep your site up and running, what tools you need for effective monitoring, and a few tips on why server uptime matters so much.

Let’s get started, shall we?

## What is Website Uptime?

### Defining Uptime

Simply put, website uptime is the percentage of time a site is operational over a specific period. The higher the uptime, the better for your website. Uptime is typically expressed as a percentage—99.9% uptime means that a website is down for less than a minute per day. Not bad, right?

But wait—how do you ensure you're close to 100% uptime? Well, that’s where **server uptime monitoring tools** come in handy.

### Why Uptime is Critical

Your website's uptime is directly related to its reliability. Downtime not only affects user experience but also Google rankings. Websites that go down frequently can suffer a drop in search engine results, and this has a ripple effect on your visibility and potential revenue.

Imagine someone visiting your site only to find that it’s down. Chances are, they won’t come back.

Oh, and let’s not forget about **UptimeFriend**, which also provides seamless uptime tracking without overcomplicating things.
