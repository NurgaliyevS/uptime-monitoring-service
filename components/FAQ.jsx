      <p>

        provides a better user experience. Our service, UptimeFriend, offers
        comprehensive web monitoring tools to keep your site running smoothly.

    question: "Can team members get notifications too?",
    answer: (

  {
    question: "How often does UptimeFriend check my websiteâ€™s uptime?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        The monitoring interval depends on your subscription settings. The Free
        plan checks every 5 minutes, the Personal plan every 3 minutes, the Team
        plan every 1 minute, and the Enterprise plan every 30 minutes.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between HTTP monitoring and ping monitoring?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        HTTP monitoring checks the availability of your website through HTTP
        requests to your site, while ping monitoring checks the availability of
        your network devices by sending ICMP echo requests (pings). Both types
        of monitoring help keep your website and network online.
